# assessmentgenerator
Generates random assignments and answers

assessmentgeneratorv2.py --
 - generates a folder called output
 - reads student names and numbers from studinfo.csv
 - creates a html page using the students details and random questions
 - includes a unique examid that represents the questions asked and makes an index file of this information

I then use a batch file I found to make a html file that lists all of the assignment files.  Then use an old internet explorer trick to print all files to the printer for manual handout.

See the Issues section of this github to see what needs doing.
